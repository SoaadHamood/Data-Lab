# Data-Lab

**Data-Lab Marketplace** is a collaborative marketplace for sharing web-scraped datasets created as part of the Data Lab course. This initiative addresses the challenge of limited budget by pooling resources and enabling students to share and reuse datasets efficiently.

## How to Contribute

1. **Add Your Dataset**  
   Create a separate folder for your dataset. The folder name should clearly reflect the dataset's content or purpose.

2. **Documentation**  
   Include a `README.md` file inside your folder. This file should provide:
   - A clear and concise **description** of the dataset.
   - An **explanation of the columns/attributes** and their meanings.
   - Any additional details needed to understand and use the dataset effectively.

3. **Code (if needed)**  
   If your dataset requires specific processing, cleaning, or usage instructions, include example code snippets or scripts to help others get started.

4. **We would love if our work was appreciated and we would be grateful for some bonus of any kind 🐸**
